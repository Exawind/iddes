The files in this directory tree contain statistical data extracted from direct numerical simulations of fully developed plane turbulent channel flow. Some of these data are discussed in Myoungkyu Lee and Robert D. Moser "Direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flow up to Re_tau = 5200", Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 2015, vol. 774, pp. 395-415.

The data are normalized with friction velocity and viscosity. The center of channel is not computed due to code performance optimization.
