The files in this directory (chan180/pdfs) contain velocity and
pressure probability density functions extracted from direct numerical
simulations of fully developed plane turbulent channel flow at
Re_tau=180. The simulations are reported in "DNS of Turbulent Channel
Flow up to Re_tau=590," by R. D. Moser, J. Kim & N. N. Mansour, 1998
(submitted to Physics of Fluids). A preprint is available at
http://www.tam.uiuc.edu/Faculty/Moser/channel. Before final
publication of a paper citing this data, please check this site for an
up-to-date reference.

This directory contains a set of files named chan180.pdf.<number>,
where the number indicates the y-location of the pdf (in + units
rounded to the nearest integer).

Please report any problems with the data to R. D. Moser
