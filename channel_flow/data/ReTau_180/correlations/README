The files in this directory (chan180/correlations) contain one-dimensional
two-point correlations extracted from direct numerical simulations of
fully developed plane turbulent channel flow at Re_tau=180. The
simulations are reported in "DNS of Turbulent Channel Flow up to
Re_tau=590," by R. D. Moser, J. Kim & N. N. Mansour, 1998 (submitted
to Physics of Fluids). A preprint is available at
http://www.tam.uiuc.edu/Faculty/Moser/channel. Before final
publication of a paper citing this data, please check this site for an
up-to-date reference.

This directory contains a set of files named
chan180.<extension>.<number>, where the number indicates the
y-location of the correlations (in + units rounded to the nearest
integer), and the extension indicates the type of correlations in the
file. The extensions are

  xcorr -- 1-D auto-correlations in the x-direction 

  xccorr -- 1-D cross-correlations in the x-direction 

  zcorr -- 1-D auto-correlations in the z-direction 

  zccorr -- 1-D cross-correlations in the z-direction 

Please report any problems with the data to R. D. Moser
r-moser@uiuc.edu.
